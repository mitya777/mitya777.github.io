I wrote a Bookmarking tool to teach myself web development.

Here is how it works:


Saving

I hate organizing my bookmarks by folders.
The problem with folders is that you have to make a decision about which one folder to place content in when in reality the content should appear in multiple folders.
Tags are superior in this respect but it can take time to think up and write a descriptive tag.
Another problem is that I always forget that I saved something which was related to my current quest for information.

I wanted a tool that would make it easy to save bookmarks with relevant tags and present that information to me when it is the most useful to me. 


I search a lot. New information I come in contact with is usually the result of a Google search.
When I search I type in a description of what I am looking for into the search engine.
Might as well use that description to tag the interesting stuff I find.

It might go something like this:

I search for 'which is a better editor Vim or Emacs'

I find two articles I love and easily tag both with: 'which is a better editor Vim or Emacs'.
One month later when I search for Vim vs Emacs through the search engine I am reminded of the articles I found by seeing them alongside my search results.
