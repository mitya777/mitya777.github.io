It is not exceptional to succumb to tribalism.

It is not exceptional to fetishize your tragedy while shrugging at another's.

It is not exceptional to cower at the unfamiliar.

That's just standard ape behavior.

The weak default.

A national fight or flight, base, lizard instinct.

It is exceptional to transcend this monkey urge.

It is exceptional to acknowledge our differences, assimilate them, and profit from them.

It is exceptional, and Christian, to accept the risk of suffering in order to alleviate the greater suffering of others.

To become human.
