August 9th, 2014: Michael Brown is shot by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer. This sets off a series of protests and catalyzes the #BlackLivesMatter movement and a conversation about police brutality.

March 4th, 2015: the U.S. Justice Department issues a report on the state of Ferguson policing and criminal justice system.

According to the report Ferguson is a dystopian government arbitrarily violating the constitutional rights and human dignity of its citizens to illegally tax them at the point of a gun.

Lending their support to groups like #BlackLivesMatter is an opportunity for Conservatives to champion their most cherished beliefs: love of constitution, and hate of taxes.


In [We The People: A Restoration of Constitutional Government](https://www.gop.com/platform/we-the-people/) the Republican Platform declares:

> **We are the party of the Constitution**, the solemn compact which confirms our God-given individual rights and assures that all Americans stand equal before the law.

The Justice Department report on Ferguson revealed:

> ...a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that **violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution**, and federal statutory law.

The first point of the [Tea Party Platform](http://www.teaparty-platform.com/) proclaims:

> **Eliminate Excessive Taxes** - Excessively high taxes are a burden for those exercising their personal liberty to work hard and prosper as afforded by the Constitution.

The Justice Department report:

> Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs.

> ...**many officers appear to see some residents... less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.**

There is no greater Conservative cause today than the reformation of oppressive police departments and court systems like those found in Ferguson.
