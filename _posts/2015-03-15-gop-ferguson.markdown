Ferguson, Missouri is a dystopian government arbitrarily violating the constitutional rights and human dignity of its citizens to illegally tax them at the point of a gun.

This was the finding of the March 4th, 2015 Justice Department report.

The report came in response to the August 9th, 2014 slaying of unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson which set off a series of protests and catalyzed the #BlackLivesMatter movement along with a national conversation about police brutality.

Conservatives have an opportunity to champion their most cherished beliefs - love of constitution, and hate of taxes - by lending their support to the #BlackLivesMatter movement.


In [We The People: A Restoration of Constitutional Government](https://www.gop.com/platform/we-the-people/) the Republican Platform declares:

> **We are the party of the Constitution**, the solemn compact which confirms our God-given individual rights and assures that all Americans stand equal before the law.

The Justice Department report on Ferguson revealed:

> ...a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that **violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution**, and federal statutory law.

The first point of the [Tea Party Platform](http://www.teaparty-platform.com/) proclaims:

> **Eliminate Excessive Taxes** - Excessively high taxes are a burden for those exercising their personal liberty to work hard and prosper as afforded by the Constitution.

The Justice Department report:

> Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs.

> ...**many officers appear to see some residents... less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.**

There is no greater Conservative cause today than the reformation of oppressive police departments and court systems like those found in Ferguson.
