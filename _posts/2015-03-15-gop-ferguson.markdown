\#BlackLivesMatter is a movement catalyzed by the police killing of Mike Brown, an unarmed black man.

Supporting #BlackLivesMatter is an opportunity for Conservatives to champion their most deeply cherished beliefs.

In [We The People: A Restoration of Constitutional Government](https://www.gop.com/platform/we-the-people/) the Republican Platform states:

> **We are the party of the Constitution**, the solemn compact which confirms our God-given individual rights and assures that all Americans stand equal before the law.

The Justice Department report on Ferguson revealed:

> ...a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that **violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution**, and federal statutory law.

The first point of the [Tea Party Platform](http://www.teaparty-platform.com/) states:

> **Eliminate Excessive Taxes** - Excessively high taxes are a burden for those exercising their personal liberty to work hard and prosper as afforded by the Constitution.

The Justice Department report:

> Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs.

> ...**many officers appear to see some residents... less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.**


According to this report Ferguson is a dystopian government arbitrarily violating the constitutional rights and human dignity of its citizens to illegally tax them at the point of a gun.

These government practices violate the American axiom that: All men and women are created equal under the law.

There is no more conservative cause in America today than the reformation of the Ferguson police department and municipal justice system.
