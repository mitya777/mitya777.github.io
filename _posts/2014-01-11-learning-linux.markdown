I love Linux. I love Linux. I love Linux.

Joey chanted this a year after we received our Comp Sci degrees.

I had shunned my degree to follow my father into real estate development.
Joey had begun his *real* education as an out-of-college code monkey. 

The chant seemed crazy to me.
How can you love an Operating System?
If you *were* capable of loving an OS, how could it be Linux?

Using Linux was like writing a paper. It was ugly, and hard to use.
Before iPod, Mac was a footnote.
Windows was for gamers and I was a member of Starcraft Anonymous.
Almost a decade later I'm writing this post in Vim.

Joey's chant doesn't seem so crazy anymore. 
I'm exporing, learning, and falling for Li.. OSX. 

I play with some Linux Virtual Machines for work, but my primary exposure to \*nix is through OSX' unix core.

It's little wonder why Mac laptops are an in demand developer tool.
They combine a beautifully designed graphical user interface with the power flexibility of the unix command line.
