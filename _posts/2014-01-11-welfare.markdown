people complaining about welfare.
makes sense because this abuse is very easy to see and people have a strong sense of fairness (monkey experiment). 
this abuse is much easier to see and feel than the DSL-obscured abuse of corporate accountants and paid-for politicians with corporate welfare.
So it is much easier to exploit, turning people against each other/distracted to keep the real abuse going.
Also people don't see the poverty the welfare is meant to stauch because of societal stratification. (Then why do they see the abuse? They are told about it)
The exploit is of human cognigitve bias (DSL idea again, and how it can abstract away/euphamize away real abuser).

Solution? Data.
